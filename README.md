# Finch Ecology
This repository contains an R file that I coded for an ecology course assignment. The assignment was meant to practice data wrangling, modeling, and data visualization techniques. I calculated important statistical values, determined correlation between values, created simple scatter plots and histograms to visualize the information calculated, and created a model to determine significant associations.
